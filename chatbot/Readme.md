# Chatbot Implementation Using NLP

This repository contains the implementation of a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is designed to engage in conversation with users and answer questions based on pre-defined intents and user input. It uses NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and pattern matching to understand and respond intelligently.

## Features
- **Intent Classification**: Identifies the user's intent using NLP models.
- **Response Generation**: Generates appropriate responses based on user input.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization for input text.
- **Pattern Matching**: Matches user input with predefined patterns and responses.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Command-line interface to interact with the chatbot.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The implementation is written in Python.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Used for text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization).
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms used in intent classification.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Optional): For more advanced chatbot implementations using neural networks.

## Installation

To run the chatbot, make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed, and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-nlp.git
   cd chatbot-nlp
2. Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Interact with the Chatbot:
Once the program is running, type your message and the chatbot will respond based on the trained model and pattern matching rules.

4.Exit the Chatbot: 
Type "exit" to terminate the chat.

Training Data Format
The training data (located in data/intents.json) should have the following format:

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "greeting",
      "patterns": [
        "Hi",
        "Hello",
        "Good morning",
        "Hey"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "Hello, how can I help you?",
        "Hi there! How can I assist you?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "intent": "goodbye",
      "patterns": [
        "Bye",
        "Goodbye",
        "See you later"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "Goodbye! Have a great day!",
        "See you soon!"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Each intent contains a list of patterns (user input) and corresponding responses.
The model will classify the input into one of the intents, and the chatbot will select a random response from the corresponding intent.

Future Improvements
Advanced NLP models: Implement deep learning-based models (e.g., RNN, LSTM, BERT) for more accurate intent classification and response generation.
Sentiment Analysis: Enhance the chatbot to detect the sentiment of the userâ€™s input for more personalized responses.
GUI Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
